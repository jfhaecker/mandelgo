= A concurrent Mandelbrot image generator written in go. Impress your friends with a psychedelic movie and conquer the Mandelbrot universe.

== Getting started
You need a go installation.
Having ffmpeg and mpv installed just `make all` and watch the movie. For just generating the images do `make build run`.
By default 650 images are generated for a  wonderful flight.

== Code
Code should be self-documenting. For some mathematics you can find some comments for further information.
